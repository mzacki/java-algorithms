     * Spock:
     *  - testing framework
     *  - runs on JUnit runner
     *  - can mock and stub - like Mockito - but it's included
     *  - embraces the paradigm of behavior-driven development (BDD)
     *  - given / when / then declarative style of BDD

     *
     *  Spock: Groovy testing Java code
     *  the reverse is possible:
     *  - JUnit Java testing Groovy code
     *  - JUnit Groovy (sic!) testing Groovy OR Java code
     *  - Groovy supports a GroovyTestCase class, which extends the standard
     TestCase from JUnit
    */

    /**
     * other advantages:
     * - gives clear details where test fails
     * - readible methods naming (natural language description)
     * - readible given / when / then blocks, often with English didascalia (BDD)
     * */
